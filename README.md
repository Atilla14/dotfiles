# My dotfiles

My system dotfiles

* Zshrc
* Tmux
* Vim
* Emacs (Spacemacs)

## Todo

* Fix zshrc config mess (Its actually slow, takes about 1-2 seconds or prompt to show up - maybe plugins?)
* Tmux add package manager
* Fix emacs org mode not working properly
* Move emacs config to org mode
* Vim clean up

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk.

I already screwed up my system so its fine.
